The lyrics and vocals calmly unravel the emotions of Sunmi. It draws a lot of sympathy with the lyrics that represent modern people who constantly suffer from the weight and gravity of life."

She introduced the song, 'Eight,' as a short novel in which she confessed her 28 years of age using various metaphors with a fictional character called 'You.'"
